# Scrollytelling-on-ocean-pollution

IDG1293 Assignment 3

The project consists of a scrollytelling story, which portraits ocean life and how it is affeced by pollution in regards to United Nations sustainable developmental goal number 14.

The project is useful as it aims to spread awareness around plastic polution and what it does to the enviroment, especially the ocean.

Users can implement this project by downloading a zip folder of the repository which is located in the menu under the green button, "code", on the top right corner of the project window. Preferably, the user will unzip the file and open the file with a code editor, to access all of the material.

Within this project, we're using Visual Studio Code as the main technology for implementing the different development components. For reference, the HTML contains the structures of the page with SVGs. The SCSS (Sass) contains styling, compiled into CSS. Lastly, the JavaScript is applied for the purpose of using intersection observer for on-scroll animations to be put into effect. The scrollytelling is optimalised to fit browser sizes around 1280x569, with some components not being accurately adjusted to bigger browser windows.

Figma is also used to create different SVGs, which are then optimized with https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/?fbclid=IwAR22CPloKJh7A0mYnoJc87xIQNUlKg0j7keLeZKvM5M7ETaLGoat4jGC_jY (some of the SVG's are not optimized as it resulted in faulty rendering on the page).
