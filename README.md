# Scrollytelling-on-ocean-pollution

Group name: pink dogs (cause we love pink dogs - duh)

The project task covered in this repository is given to us through NTNU's webdevelopments course, IDG1293. The task revolves around using different technologies to develop a scrollytelling website about one of the 17 UN sustainable development goals.

These goals can be found here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals

This project will cover Sustainability Goal 12, and implemented, will present a scrollytelling website, which will broadcast information about and offer a useful learning source about the said goal and how we can achieve it.

Users can implement this project by downloading a zip folder of the repository which is located in the menu under the green button, "code", on the top right corner of the project window. Preferably, the user will unzip the file and open the file with code, to access all of the material.

Requests concerning the usage and/or execution of the project, can be directed to the contributors through E-mail;

Within this project, we're using Visual Studio Code as the main technology for implementing the different development components. For reference, the HTML contains the structures of the page. The SCSS (Sass) contains styling, compiled into CSS. Lastly, the JavaScript is applied for the purpose of the on-scroll animations to be put into effect.

The project is maintained and contributed to by Marianne Mytting, Mille Dishington and Mathias Kvarsvik Kvalv√•g.
